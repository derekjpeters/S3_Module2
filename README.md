# Advanced JavaScript Array Methods

## Introduction

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on leveraging advanced JavaScript array methods! This repository is dedicated to mastering `forEach`, `filter`, and `map` to optimize and simplify array manipulation. These powerful methods are indispensable tools in a developer's toolkit, facilitating efficient data processing, transformation, and analysis in web development projects.

### Why It Matters

Understanding and utilizing `forEach`, `filter`, and `map` is crucial for writing clean, efficient, and readable code. These methods embody the principles of functional programming, allowing developers to perform complex data manipulations with less code, fewer bugs, and more readable syntax. They are essential for handling real-world data processing tasks such as filtering user inputs, analyzing datasets, or transforming objects for user interfaces.

## Core Competencies

### **1. `forEach` for Side Effects**

- **Definition**: Iterates over an array, executing a callback for each element.
- **Use Cases**: Applying a function to each element, such as DOM manipulation or logging data.

### **2. `filter` for Selective Arrays**

- **Definition**: Creates a new array with elements that pass a specified condition.
- **Use Cases**: Extracting subsets of data from an array, like filtering user inputs or search results.

### **3. `map` for Transformation**

- **Definition**: Generates a new array by transforming each element with a given function.
- **Use Cases**: Modifying data structures, converting data types, or preparing data for display.

## Sprint Challenge Preview

### **Challenge**: `categorizeScores`

- **Objective**: Write a function that categorizes an array of scores into 'High', 'Medium', or 'Low'.
- **Functionality**: The function should return an object with arrays for each category, demonstrating your mastery of array manipulation methods.

## Conclusion

The journey through `forEach`, `filter`, and `map` has equipped you with the skills to tackle a wide range of programming challenges. By embracing these methods, you enhance your code's readability, efficiency, and maintainability, marking your growth as a proficient JavaScript developer.
